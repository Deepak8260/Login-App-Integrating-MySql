### Step 4: Install Dependencies
1. Install all required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ![alt text](/Screenshots/5.png).

---

### Step 5: Configure the `.env` File
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_user_name
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=db_name
   ```
   ![alt text](/Screenshots/6.png).

   
---

### Step 6: Set Up the Database
1. Log in to your MySQL server or create a new connection in mysql workbench and create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE db_name;
   ```

---

### Step 7: Run the Flask Application
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Best Practices
1. **Environment Variables**: Use the `.env` file to securely store sensitive information like database credentials. Never commit this file to version control.
2. **Virtual Environment**: Always use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for database connections and user inputs.
4. **Database Security**: Hash user passwords before storing them in the database for enhanced security.
5. **Code Modularity**: Keep database logic and application logic separate for maintainability.
